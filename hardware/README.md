# Raspberry Pi Security System Hardware

I used a [Raspberry Pi Model A+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-a-plus/) because it's the smallest pi with the camera interface. The frame is made with [Makerbeam](http://www.makerbeam.com/), 4x vertical 66mm beams and 8x horizontal 54mm beams.

Raspberry Pi camera mount 3D printed from [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/).

DWG CAD files are in hardware/cad-files or you can see models here on Spaceways:
